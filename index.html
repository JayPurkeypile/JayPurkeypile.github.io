                    Hello, I'm Jocelyn Purkeypile. I am currently a college student majoring in interactive media. So far, I am in the second term of my schooling and have taken courses on photography, Photoshop, illustrator, the basics of Interactive media, HTML, 2D design, and generalized computers courses. 
                    As of thus far I haven't yet worked on a professional project outside of my schooling though I am more than interested in trying my hands at it.
                    I find an interest in making mood boards (can be found on my mood boards page) and other designs on procreate (some of which you can find in the digital arts section. 
                    I'm also interested in photography.
                    The reason I chose this field is because I have always loved art: music digital media buy hand drawings photography story writing ex. 
                    But I've never really found a way to exert that love of art. 
                    I was looking for career paths and I couldn't quite find anything that stuck.
                    I looked at education nursing cyber security all sorts of options and all the options I viewed either wouldn't provide livable wage or I had no interest in. 
                    That's when I heard about interactive media.
                     I absolutely love the fact that it's an art-based career with a bit of marketing I get to dip my toes into all sorts of different aspects and categories of The digital world including videos different forms of social media different types of media I get a design different things it's always changing and the fact that there is enough control to it to where I don't have to rely on my own motivation but at the same time there's enough leniency on it to where I don't feel suffocated if that makes any sense.
                      After college, I plan to find a job within the field, preferably an office job as I would like to have some structure in my schedule. 
                      Then I eventually want to work my way into a stay-at-home job.
